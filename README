	BOSTON
       ========

 Boston is an icon theme inspired by functionalist design.
 A minimal and elegant look for your desktop.
 
 It is intended to be used with GNOME Shell 3.32 or higher and adapt well with Adwaita.
 For maximum enjoyment, it's recommended to visualize Files/Nautilus content at 100-133%.
