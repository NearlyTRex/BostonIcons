**Here you can request an icon or a compatibility. Please, before making any request consider these options:**

1. Check that your proposal hasn't been previously provided or added. For this you can read the existing [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/heychrisd/Boston-Icons/blob/master/CHANGELOG) file in every Boston release.
2. Check the wiki to know if your proposal isn't opposite to project philosophy. You can read main points on [Home](https://github.com/heychrisd/Boston-Icons/wiki) and [Questions and answers](https://github.com/heychrisd/Boston-Icons/wiki/Questions-and-answers).
