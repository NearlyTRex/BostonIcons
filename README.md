# Boston - Icon theme for GNOME Shell

**Boston is an icon theme inspired by functionalist design.**

An elegant and sober look for your desktop.

It is intended to be used with GNOME Shell 3.32 or higher and adapt well with its default settings.

For maximum enjoyment, it's recommended to visualize Files/Nautilus content at 100-133%.
