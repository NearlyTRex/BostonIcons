<h1 align="center">
 BOSTON
</h1>

**Boston is a minimalist and functional icon theme focused on basic shapes, a reduced color palette and visual hierarchy.**

An elegant look for your desktop.

It is intended to be used with GNOME Shell 3.32 or higher and adapt well with its default settings.

For maximum enjoyment, it's recommended to visualize Files/Nautilus content at 100-133%.
